What are the most common types of charts and when would you use them?

Answer:
•	Bar Charts: Used to compare quantities of different categories.
•	Line Charts: Used to show trends over time.
•	Pie Charts: Used to show parts of a whole, but should be used sparingly and only when the number of categories is small.
•	Histograms: Used to visualize the distribution of a dataset, typically for continuous data.
•	Box Plots: Used to show the spread and identify outliers in a dataset.
