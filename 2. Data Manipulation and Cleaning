What is data cleaning, and why is it important?

Answer:
Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and rectifying errors or inconsistencies in a dataset. 
It is important because inaccurate, missing, or inconsistent data can lead to incorrect analysis, unreliable results, and 
poor decision-making. Common cleaning tasks include handling missing data, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and addressing outliers.

Example Tasks:
•	Missing Data: Impute, remove, or flag missing values.
•	Outliers: Identify outliers and decide whether to remove or adjust them.
•	Duplicates: Remove duplicate rows to prevent redundancy.
•	Data Type Conversion: Ensure columns have the appropriate data type (e.g., converting strings to dates).
