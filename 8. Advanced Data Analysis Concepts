What is machine learning, and how is it relevant to data analysis?

Answer:
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building models that allow computers to learn patterns 
from data without explicit programming. It is relevant to data analysis because machine learning algorithms can be used to make predictions, 
classify data, and uncover hidden insights from large and complex datasets.
  •	Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train the model (e.g., classification, regression).
  •	Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering).
  •	Reinforcement Learning: Models based on learning through rewards and penalties.

Common algorithms:
  •	Linear Regression: For predicting continuous values.
  •	Logistic Regression: For binary classification problems.
  •	K-Means Clustering: For clustering data into groups.
  •	Decision Trees and Random Forests: For classification and regression tasks.
