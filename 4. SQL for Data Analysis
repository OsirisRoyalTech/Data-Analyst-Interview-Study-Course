What is a JOIN in SQL, and what types of JOINs are there?

Answer:
A JOIN in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

Types of JOINs:
•	INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
•	LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. If no match, NULL values are returned.
•	RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. If no match, NULL values are returned.
•	FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. If no match, NULL values are returned.
•	CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all combinations of rows.
