What is EDA, and why is it important?

Answer:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, 
often using statistical graphics, plots, and other data visualization methods. EDA helps you understand the underlying structure of the data, 
detect patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. It is a crucial first step in any data analysis project.

Common techniques in EDA:
•	Summary Statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, percentiles.
•	Data Visualizations: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
•	Correlation Analysis: To identify relationships between variables (e.g., Pearson’s correlation).
